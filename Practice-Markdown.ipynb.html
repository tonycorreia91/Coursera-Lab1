# ## Practice Markdown

# This notebook lets you experiment with producing repeatable technical documentation.  Use this notebook to do the following actions:
# 
# * Create a code cell and print a Python Hello World statement:  `print("hello world")`
# * Create a Markdown Cell and add a Title using `#` and then a statement using plain text.  You can looks at the source code for this cell to get an idea of how to use Markdown.
# * Take some ideas from the [Master Markdown Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and implement them here.
# * Download this notebook as a `.ipynb` file and check into a Github Project.  You can [see an example here](https://github.com/noahgift/duke-coursera-ccf-lab1/blob/main/Practice-Markdown.ipynb).
# * Open your notebook in Google Colab and save it into the same Github Project.  You can [see an example here](https://github.com/noahgift/duke-coursera-ccf-lab1/blob/main/Practice_Markdown_with_colab.ipynb).
